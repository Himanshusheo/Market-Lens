Channel ROI Analysis Results:

1. Increase investment in high-performing channels (Current Months): SEM, Online marketing, Radio, Content Marketing, Digital, Sponsorship, Affiliates, Other
   These channels generate more revenue than their cost, providing positive ROI
2. Reassess or reduce investment in low-performing channels (Current Months): TV
   These channels generate less revenue than their cost, providing negative or minimal ROI
3. Increase investment in high-performing channels (Next Months): Online marketing, SEM, Digital, Radio, Content Marketing, Affiliates, Sponsorship, Other
   These channels generate more revenue than their cost, providing positive ROI
4. Reassess or reduce investment in low-performing channels (Next Months): TV
   These channels generate less revenue than their cost, providing negative or minimal ROI
5. Consider running controlled experiments to validate MMM findings before making major budget shifts
6. Re-run MMM analysis quarterly to capture changing market dynamics and seasonal effects
7. For channels with negative impact, investigate whether they serve important non-revenue goals (e.g., brand building)

Strategic Recommendations:
1. Prioritize customer satisfaction initiatives as they significantly impact future ROI
2. Set minimum monthly ROI targets based on the observed relationship with GMV
3. Aim for ROI above 0.25 for high-performing channels (Current Months)
4. Aim for ROI above 0.18 for high-performing channels (Next Months)
6. Implement a monthly ROI-to-GMV tracking system to monitor how this relationship evolves over time
